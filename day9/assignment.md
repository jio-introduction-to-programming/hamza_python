Topic 1: Modules / Packages

## Research: 
- Investigate the difference between a module and a package in Python. Provide examples to illustrate how they are used and their significance in Python programming. You can explain by writing an 
article and providing relevant examples. 


## Implementation: 
- Create a Python module named "math_operations.py" that contains functions for basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Import this module into another Python script and demonstrate the usage of its functions.

## Exploration: 
- Research and explore popular third-party packages available in the Python Package Index (PyPI). Choose one package that interests you and explain its purpose, functionality, and how to install and use it in your Python projects.
